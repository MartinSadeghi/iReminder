# iReminder

iReminder is an iOS application that allows users to create and manage reminders. The app has two tab bar controllers: "Add Reminder" and "All Reminders". In the "Add Reminder" tab, users can create a new reminder with a title, date, and time. In the "All Reminders" tab, users can see all their saved reminders.
